Target audience is mixed:

- new developers who want to approach F# from zero, using .NET Core in an xplat environment 
- experienced F# developers who want to know what are the changes in the new sdk, not just for .NET Core

Goal of this workshop is to show the lovely and improved feedback loop for developers, in all common scenarios:

- From zero to a new console app, adding dependancies, build it, debug it, and finally the options for deployments (self contained, framework dependent) 
- From zero to new library, adding tests, create a nuget package, push it to a feed. 
- How to build and deploy to docker and example web app 
- A tour of the extensibility of sdk, to add new tools or create a template (based on new .NET Templating)
